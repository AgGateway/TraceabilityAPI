# Traceability API
AgGateway Traceability API enables management of Traceable Resource Units, a Container's State and Item Instances used in the context of Critical Tracking Events.

## Abstract
There is increasing demand for food traceability, ranging from consumers wanting to know where their food comes from (GMO, organic, climate-smart commodities), to manufacturer's of agricultural inputs wanting to know the effectiveness of their products as used by farmers.  Existing traceability requirements focus on the supply chain of packaged packages from their origin to the retail grocery stores, with regulations provided by the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) from the US Food and Drug Administration which suggests used of Critical Tracking Events and Key Data Elements to manage this challenge. 
 Excluded from the Food List is Raw Agricultural Commodities (RACs) such as grains and milk, which due to commling, was viewed as a daunting effort to manage.  AgGateway members studied this challenge since the FSMA's introduction, and introduced new types of Critical Tracking Event including the Transfer Event, when used with the Traceable Resource Unit, has become the foundation model to confidently manage RACs; only limited by existing farm equipment design, use of emerging AI-based grain and fluid flow models, and farm and field practice changes.  Taking it a step further, the work group leveraged new and existing standards-based 'core components' assembled in a NIST developed software tool called 'connectCenter'.  The connectCenter generated Traceability API is an OpenAPI specification describing endpoints to manage these resources, allowing software developers to generate code in the programming language of their choice and embed these capabilities into OEM platforms, farm management information systems, and retailer ERPs -- accelerating adoption by making it easier for the farmer.
